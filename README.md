## **API Details**
### **USGS Earthquake API**
- **Base URL**: `https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson`
- **Response Format**: GeoJSON
- **Example Response**:
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "properties": {
        "mag": 5.6,
        "place": "114 km WNW of Houma, Tonga",

}
```

## üó∫Ô∏è How It Works
 Data Fetching: The app fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API.
 Mapping: Earthquakes are plotted as markers on an interactive Leaflet map.
 Details: Clicking a marker shows earthquake details (e.g., magnitude, time).
