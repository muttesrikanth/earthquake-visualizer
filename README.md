# üåç Earthquake Visualizer

An interactive web application to visualize recent earthquake activity worldwide. Built using React, react-leaflet for mapping, and the USGS Earthquake API, this project helps geography enthusiasts and students understand seismic patterns in a user-friendly way.

## üöÄ Features
### üåé Interactive Map:
Displays earthquake locations with real-time data.
### üìä Details at a Glance: 
Shows earthquake magnitude, location, and time.
### üîç Filter by Magnitude, Time & Region: 
Focus on earthquakes above a certain magnitude. Earthquakes happen on time period, filter by region
### üì± Responsive Design: 
Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling: 
Provides user-friendly messages for network errors or no data.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### Framework: React
### Styling: Tailwind CSS
### Mapping Library: react-leaflet
### API: USGS Earthquake API
## üì• Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your system.
Basic knowledge of React and npm/yarn commands
## üó∫Ô∏è How It Works
### Data Fetching: The app fetches earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API.
### Mapping: Earthquakes are plotted as markers on an interactive Leaflet map.
### Details: Clicking a marker shows earthquake details (e.g., magnitude, time).



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
